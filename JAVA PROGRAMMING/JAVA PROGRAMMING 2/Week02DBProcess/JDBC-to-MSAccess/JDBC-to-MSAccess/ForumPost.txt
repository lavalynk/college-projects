I found a reasonable solution that allows for use of existing code with a change only to open database connection logic.

UCanAccess is an open-source, JDBC driver.

http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html

That has two dependencies, one of which has two more dependencies.

jackcess-2.0.0.jar or later

    commons-lang-2.4.jar

    commons-logging-1.0.4.jar

hsqldb.jar(2.2.5)

Those are all open-source.  Do an internet search, download, unzip if necessary and put all four jars plus the one for UCanAccess in a directory in your project (e.g. JDBC-to-MSAccess).  If using Ecplise, add to your build path by choosing from the menu "Project / Properties / Java Compiler / Libraries / Add External JARs" and select all five jar files.

The connection logic is really simple:

---

String strConnectionString = "";

Connection conAdministrator = null;

// Register driver

Class.forName( "net.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanaccessDriver" );

            

// System.getProperty( "user.dir" ) => Current working directory from where application was started

strConnectionString = "jdbc:ucanaccess://" + System.getProperty( "user.dir" )  + "\\Your-database-name.<mdb or accdb>";

// Open a connection to the database

conAdministrator = DriverManager.getConnection( strConnectionString );

---

Happy coding
